        <p class="intro">
            Will is a Barber at Dennis and Dalhman in Omaha, Nebraska. He graduated Barber school in 2018 and hit his 5 year goal (manage a shop and have full books) in 2.5 years. The pandemic set everyone back, but he is back to being booked out and the shop is expanding to a second location. Before Barber school, Will was a warehouse worker and a maintenance guy. He worked every aspect of the warehouse, which gave him the knowledge he needed to start a supply company for other barbers. 
        </p>

        <p>Will says his favorite thing about being a barber is the sense of community that comes with having regulars who come see you every week or two. Also, the networking that goes on. He helps people get jobs, linking people he has gotten to know with people in the field they want to be in or are looking to grow in. He always enjoyed the barber shop as a kid and now gets to live that dream every day. As a fellow barber, cares about how each sale impacts barbers and their shops. He decided to start a supply company because he is not disconnected the way current supply companies are. He can talk to prospective clients with firsthand knowledge. </p>

        <p>Future plans for Will are to become regional director for a multitude of shops, overseeing expansion and development for barber shops, but still cutting the hair of long-time clients. He also wants to expand his supply company for barber products as well as being an active community member. </p>
